  <li><strong>SCORING</strong><br> Points in tennis are called love, 15, 30, 40, deuce and advantage.  <br>
  <br>

  <li><strong>THE GAME</strong><br>
  0, or nothing, is called 'love'. It is believed to come from the pronunciation of the
  French word 'l' oeuf', which sounds like 'love. The use of 'l'ouef', meaning 'egg', to
  denote nothing, is derived from the shape of an egg. The first point won by a player is
  called 15, the second point, 30, the third point, 40. If a player then wins a fourth point
  before his opponent has won three points, then that player wins the game. However, if both
  players have won three points (40-all), the score is then deuce, and it is necessary to
  win two points in a row to win the game. The word 'deuce' comes from an Old French word
  'deus', meaning 'two'. The first point won after a score of deuce is called advantage,
  either to the server of receiver, but if that player loses the next point then the score
  returnes to deuce. Here are the score of the game in which deuse occurs:<br>

  <ul>
  <li>15 - love
  <li>15 - all
  <li>30 - 15
  <li>40 - 15
  <li>40 - 30
  <li>deuce
  <li>advantage receiver (or player' s name)<br>
  <li>deuce
  <li>advantage server (or player's name)
  <li>game server
  </ul>
  <br>

  <li><strong>THE SET</strong><br>
  The first player who wins six games, wins the set, provided he has won two more games than
  his opponent. If the score reaches five games to six, then the winning player must win the
  next game. If the score reaches six games all, then it becomes a tiebreak.<br>
  Men usually may play the best out of five sets and women, the best out of three sets.<br>

  <br>
  <li><strong>THE TIEBREAK</strong><br>
  <br>
  In most matches, when a game score of six all is reached, a tiebreak is played. In a
  tiebreak the points are called 1, 2, 3, etc. Each side serves only once. This is so an not
  to give too great an advantage to the server. The player who wins the tiebreak game is the
  player who wins seven points with at least two more points than his opponent. He wins the
  set seven games to six. In a tiebreak the players must keep playing until one player is
  two points ahead.<br>
  In doubles the players serve alternately in the same order as before.<br>
  <br>

  <li><strong>CHANGE OF ENDS</strong><br>
  <br>
  The players change ends every time the total number of games played is uneven. This is so
  as not to give one player an advantage in outside conditions, such as wind or sun. This
  sometimes looks silly when tennis is played indoors, but those are the rules, and it also
  gives the players a chance to get some rest. In the tiebreak the players change ends after
  every six points.<br>
  <br>
  <li><strong>TIME BETWEEN POINTS</strong><br>
  <br>
  The rulebook says play must be continuous, but it also says that you may take no longer
  that thirty seconds before playing the next point.<br>

  On the changeover the resting time is one minute. So as soon as the last point of the game
  is played, you will have ninety seconds before you have to start the next point.<br>
  <br>
  <li><strong>ON THE LINE</strong><br>
  <br>
  A ball that touches only a hair of the line is in, even if 99 per cent of the ball touches
  the ground outside the line.</p>
